# MSED-Analyzer

A Bayesian Network based tool for the safety evaluation in multi sensor event detection.

## Context
The usage of smart-sensors in critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) poses new risks and challenges in terms of dependability especially when low-cost COTS devices are employed instead of custom and high-dependable ones. In such applications, having an adaptive software systems able to choose the best configuration according to Safety Integrity Level (SIL) and other non-functional indices, is a must for such applications.

## Objective
This repository reports a prototypical version of a tool able to translate a textual configuration of sensing, voting and exclusions mechianisms into a formal probabilistic model in order to infer the SIL of the configuration. The fomalisms used are Bayesian Networks (BN) and some of their derivated ones (Dynamic Bayesian Networks, DBNs, and Time-Variant Dynamic Bayesian Networks, TV-DBNs).

## Repository structure
The repository is structured as follows:
* eclipse_project: the java Eclipse project developed with source code;
* replication: this package contains some notable configurations and related outputs. This folder is mainly devoted for a quick verification of the experiments and analyses reported in scientific submitted papers.

## Replication package
The content of the *replication* folder is the following:
* sil_eval.jar: runnable jar generated by exporting the Eclipse project as a "runnable Jar";
* *.conf: input files describing notable configurations;
* *.csv: generated CSV files.

To execute the batch, run *experiment.bat* under Windows or *experiment.sh* in a BASH terminal.

## How to build your experiment
If you want to prepare your own configuration and run some experiments, you need to write a conf file. The structure
